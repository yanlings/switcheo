List out the computational inefficiencies and anti-patterns found in the code block below.
1. There are unused variables in the code. Such as "formattedBalances". This can create unncessary computation and complexity
2. console.err does not exist
3. The code maps 'sortedBalances' twice, this can cause iteration of the same array multiple times, leading to computational inefficiencies.
4. An interface was created with nothing inside. (Interface Props)
5. useWalletBalances() was used but not defined

Solution to fix the inefficiencies:
1. Added the missing property blockchain to the WalletBalance interface.
2. Used console.error for error logging.
3. Simplified the filtering logic for sortedBalances.
4. Fixed the variable name lhsPriority to balancePriority.
5. Create some sample functions such as useWalletBalances or BoxProps as these functions were used but not declared
